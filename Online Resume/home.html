                Thanks for looking! Maybe you can see a little similarity between Mario and I however the only true connection is perhaps a little ancestry Italian DNA. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In reality, I am a MEng, software engineering student soon to graduate in May 2021 from the University of Calgary, Canada, and I am proactively looking to 
                secure a suitable position as a junior software developer. Please click on the tabs above (Education/Work Experience) to see that I have demonstrated a high 
                level of excellence in all my endeavors. I am known to be a result-driven and self-motivated individual with strong analytical skills and I enjoy working within 
                a client-facing, challenging and dynamic environment. As an engineer, I naturally find solving problems and puzzles to be an enjoyable task. Within my programming experience, 
                I have encountered many small problems that obviously need to be solved in order to complete the bigger picture and I ultimately find the feeling of success almost addicting 
                once the logistics and the nasty bugs have been ironed out and the code runs smoothly.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my MEng program, I have learned multiple programming languages including Java, Python C, C++, html, js and css. Also, my prior engineering work experience at CNOOC International, 
                PetroChina and Res-Solve Solutions have all taught me the importance of methodical work fundamentals and the importance of persistent lock-step testing of code before final implementation. 
                Also while working at BRE-Group (a consulting company) I have learned the importance of continual contractor/client communication in order to ensure continual progress towards the end goal.  
                <br>
                <br>
                I would welcome an opportunity to further discuss my skills and how they might fit within your company. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you.
