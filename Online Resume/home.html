            <p>
                I am a Master of Software Engineering Student graduating in May 2021 from the University of Calgary. As a result-driven and self-motivated individual with strong analytical skills, 
                I am eager to work in a client-facing, challenging and dynamic environment. Solving problems and puzzles are very enjoyable to me, and thus is why I enjoy watching mystery movies and playing investigation video games.
                Within software engineering, I encounter many small problems that need to be solved in order to complete the bigger problem, the feeling of success I feel when all bugs have been ironed out and the code runs smoothly is addicting.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my schooling I have learned multiple programming languages including Java, Python C, C++, html, js and css. 
                My previous experience at CNOOC International, PetroChina and Res-Solve Solutions all taught me the fundamentals and potential implementations of programming, as well as the 
                importance of customer service. Working at BRE-Group (a consulting company), I had to interact with clients and even work alongside them at times to align our goals and schedules.
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe my experience working in large cross-organizational teams at CNOOC International, as well as my experience communicating with customers and aligning our goals at 
                BRE-group will greatly increase my ability to become a successful software engineer. Also, my experience creating software for industry at Res-Solve Solutions will also 
                impact my ability to understand the desires and needs of software for industry. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would welcome an opportunity to further discuss my capabilities. Feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.
                Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
